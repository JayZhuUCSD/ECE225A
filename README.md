ECE  225 Project Proposal

Problem
	What kind of law enforcement makes the city safe? ( California Crime and Law Enforcement)
 
Proposal Statement
	According to California law enforcement agencies, there were 450.7 violent crimes and 2,491.0 property crimes reported per 100,000 population. The statistics show that we are tend to be exposed to crimes everyday, which makes us to consider this topic seriously.
	This project are designed to analyze the crime situation in California and explore its relationship with law enforcement.
	I am planning to visualize the data across most cities in California. Then I will develop a probability model between the offenses and law enforcement law enforcement. 
	What needs to be emphasized is, the stronger the law enforcement force, the fewer the number of criminal cases would probably be, but the more the cost, which is a subtle trade-off topic. From another aspect, The allocation of civilian law enforcement forces also reflects the public awareness of the relevant areas and may be an influential factor, which can be also one of the considerations in this topic.

	When finishing this proposal, I am shocked to learn the horrifying shooting massacre happened in Thousand Oaks. My deep condolences to the dead and the injured!
